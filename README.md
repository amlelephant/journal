# Robust Journal System

This journal system is created for local and secure usage. This impliments a XOR encryption algorithim for the text and images that are put into the system. This system works by putting all important data offline while all the functional code is held locally.

## Documentation

The setup work if you would like to duplicate this could be tedious because it was created to work mainly on my computer but I can walk you through some basic steps. Firstly you need to set up the file arcitecture for this. The way it should work is that there is a usb file that holds all the required contents (xor key, encrypted images, encrypted text, pad text). The file is run locally on the computer but all the important data is stored on the usb. Once these files are created you must edit the cpp file in order to make all the REPLACE HERE text the correct path. Laastly, a password should be decided and updated in the correct function.
